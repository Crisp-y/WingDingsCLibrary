Wingdings font library readme - By Charlotte Crisp (cc5g18)
I have edited an existing bitmap array to allow the Wingdings font to be used on the LaFortuna.
It was based on the 5x7 bitmap array made by Steve Gunn under the Creative Commons Attribution License.
It can be used in structures such as task 2 (an LCD usage also based on Steve Gunn's work).

The designs of each character were based on the image at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings#/media/File:Wingdings.png uploaded by user Monedula

Font.h just contains the library.
The DemoCode folder contains edited code from task 2 to show each new character and "HELLO WORLD!".
It can easily be edited to show more phrases using the display_string() function.
